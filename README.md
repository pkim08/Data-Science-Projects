# Data-Science-Projects
Showcasing my data manipulation skills!

Currently honing my Python understanding in the context of Data Science/Analysis. I wanted to start documenting my work to keep track of my growth in a tanglibe way. This is a new repo so there isn't much on it yet, but I will be uploading my work here for the forseeable future. 

Check it out for yourselves and hope you enjoy!

*Disclaimer - These are all projects post-grad. No school projects will be uploaded here. I do not have access to many files from the past unfortunately.*
